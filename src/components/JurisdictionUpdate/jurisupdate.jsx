              <p>
                With a particularly stable economy and special privileges for
                foreign businesses, Switzerland has continuously been seen as a
                "landing spot" for import and export companies. For this reason,
                the country has always been a pioneer and attractive place for
                investors in terms of international trade.

                situations occur, such as getting a divorce, bankruptcy, civil
                lawsuit, and so on. That is why it is never too late to start
                seeking to establish an offshore trust to protect your assets.
