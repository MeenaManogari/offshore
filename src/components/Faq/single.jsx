        " What is the difference between a holding company and an investment company?",
      info: "Fresh entrepreneurs oftentimes cannot tell the difference between a holding company and an investment company. While they do have a lot of similarities, holding companies and investment companies each have their distinct purposes.A holding company is a parent business entity that holds the controlling stock or membership interests in its subsidiary companies. The cost to set up a holding company varies depending on the legal entity it is registered with, usually a corporation or an LLC. Large businesses usually set up a holding company because of multiple benefits it brings, including: Protecting assets, reducing risk and tax, no day-to-day management, etc.An investment company, on the other hand, does not own or directly control any subsidiary companies, but rather is engaged in the business of investing in securities. Setting up an investment company is different from setting up a holding company, as they can mostly be formed as a mutual fund, a closed-ended fund, or a unit investment trusts (UIT). Furthermore, each type of investment company has its own versions, such as stock funds, bond funds, money market funds, index funds, interval funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).",
